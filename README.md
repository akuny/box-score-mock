# box-score-mock
Proof of concept for a skeuomorphic newspaper box score app.

Bootstrapped with the inescapable [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

`box_score_data.json` adheres to the box score schema used by [Erik Berg's xmlstats API](https://erikberg.com/api/endpoints/mlb-box-score).
